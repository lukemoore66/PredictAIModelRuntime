# Predict AI Model Runtime (Tile Only)
**A Kaggle research prediction competition hosted by Google**

[Google - Fast or Slow? Predict AI Model Runtime](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-ai-model-runtime)

Train a model that predicts runtime rankings for different tile configurations when executing machine learning models on TPUs. Since a machine learning model can be represented as a graph, with nodes being operations and edges being tensors, a GNN model can be trained to predict the execution times of different configurations and rank them accordingly. A detailed description of the problem is described in the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13490).

A Jupyter Notebook that offers a solution to the above challenge via using an ensemble of Gradient Boosting Machines to predict future sales.

This notebook is also hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/skuldropr/predict-ai-model-runtime-tile-only), so you can run and or edit the code yourself for free.
